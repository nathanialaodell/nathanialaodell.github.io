title:  "No, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin Was Never a Pro-Climate Republican"

description: Recent news articles attempt to provide an alt-history version of Zeldin's past.

Let's get right to it: over the past couple weeks I have become increasingly confused as to the media's obsession with labeling Lee Zeldin, the new Environmental Protection Agency admin, an "environmental moderate turned climate denier". [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/zeldin-is-gutting-epa-and-building-political-heft-in-maga-land-00263179), [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/climate/lee-zeldin-epa.html), and [the Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/lee-zeldin-epa-climate-change-plan-b2692100.html) are amongst the many publications attempting to paint Zeldin as a moderate gone rogue. In their attempts to do so, they have described him as an "environmentalist" and a "pro-climate Republican" who has "made a complete 180-degree turn". 

For a legislator who has the voting and [campaign committee fundraising history](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/lee-zeldin/summary?cid=N00029404&cycle=CAREER&type=C) that he does, these types of labels could not be further from the truth. 

# The Methodology
Throughout this post I will be relying on the [League of Conservation Voters](https://www.lcv.org/) (LCV) voting scorecard which, interestingly enough, is the same scorecard that the aforementioned New York Times article selectively cited twice in their article. I note that they are my source because 1) they are, of course, heavily biased, and so transparency is key here, and 2) they provide Congress voting data in an easily fetchable format so that you can look at these (albeit very basic) data yourself if you so desired. 

The LCV provides a general overview of how they decide whether or not a given legislator's vote is pro- or anti-government on their site FAQ, but to save you the time: "experts" (meh) from over 20 environmental organizations come together to decide both which votes should be scored and which vote (i.e., "yay" or "nay") is considered the pro or anti vote. Legislator's annual scores are on a scale of 0 to 100, with calculations being with respect to the total number of pro-environment votes being divided by the total number of votes scored. 

Whether or not you put a lot of faith in this scoring system is up to you--I certainly am not entirely convinced. But there are no other ways to examine how legislator's are voting for environmental protections (unless you have the time to parse through thousands of bills that are packed to the gills with gibberish).

# Historical Voting in the Aggregate
To start off with, we can look at Zeldin's voting in the aggregate. He was first elected into the House in 2015 and left in 2022. Let's look at his voting history during that time frame. 

![Zeldin-Votes](/assets/img/Lee_Zeldin_Votes_grey.png)

Well, that doesn't look too great. On average, across 8 years worth of voting data, Zeldin turned in votes that would be defined as "anti-environment" **84%** of the time. 

There are a couple of caveats we should keep in mind when looking at this data. First of all, you may have noticed that after 2018 the amount of environmentally-focused pieces of legislation he voted on decreased rather sharply, especially from 2020 onwards. So, while in 2022, for example, he voted for a whopping 6.2% of pro-environment legislation, he also was simply voting less. Looking at 2016-2018 instead of 2020-2022 might be more interesting, then, depending on who you ask. Any way you slice it, though, these are absurdly high rates of anti-environment votes for a "moderate" Republican. 

Another point worth bringing up is whether or not it is fair to say that these are purely "anti-environment" votes as opposed to "anti-budget ballooning" votes (for what it is worth: with respect to environmental protections, I personally do not see a difference between the two). It would be impossible to say for sure; unfortunately, I cannot read his mind and I think he has done more than enough to prove that what he says is not always in line with how he votes. So, instead, one way we can work towards trying to address this is by looking at EPA-specific pieces of legislation he had the chance to vote on. 

# EPA Legislation
![Zeldin-EPA-Votes](/assets/img/Lee_Zeldin_EPA_Votes.png)

One of the very nice things about the LCV datasets is the fun, melodramatic vote titles such as "Undermining the Integrity of the EPA" and "Slashing EPA Funding 1, 2 and 3". One of the flaws, however, is that the "Vote.Link" column is not a vote link at all, and instead takes you to the LCV website where they give an *interpretation* of the bill being voted on. I have taken the time to replace their link with the actual bill/amendment link on Congress.gov; I would highly recommend **not** taking my word at face value and instead deciding for yourself if you believe these votes are pro- or anti-government.

Long-winded caveat aside, we can see that Zeldin has historically been wishy-washy (or, as the media calls it, "moderate") in his votes for EPA-specific measures since 2015. You will probably have also noticed that there are two different measures that targeted EPA funding--one in 2017 and another in 2020--that he voted differently on. What might have driven that? 

The 2017 amendment was an attempt to reduce the EPA budget by nearly $1.9 billion. He voted in favor of this amendment. 2020 was yet another amendment to reduce the EPA budget, but this time by an unspecified amount in order to meet then-President Donald Trump's FY21 budget requests. Did he vote the 2020 amendment down because it was not specific enough or because he truly felt the EPA should not have had its budget slashed? Unfortunately, a search for his rationale yields nothing and so we can do nothing but speculate. It is a nice perk of the job (that only our politicians are allowed to enjoy, of course) that legislators can make multiple, conflicting choices without having to bother with explaining why. We talk ad nauseam of requiring context to make sense of data, but it is impossible to do so if those who provide it refuse to give it because there is no incentive to. I digress.

In any case, I would not feel comfortable calling his string of votes from 2019-2020 with respect to the EPA as something to inspire hope or confidence in his former moderate Republican nature (I dry heave into my coffee mug every time I type the phrase "moderate Republican", by the way). And you know why it doesn't inspire confidence?...

# Lee Zeldin vs. His Peers
Because even by his peer's standards (that is, New York republicans), Zeldin has consistently proven himself to be radically against pro-environment legislation. 

First, let's look at his votes compared to the entire NY House body.

![Zeldin-v-NY](/assets/img/Lee_Zeldin_NY_State.png)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Zeldin was far below his fellow House members during his time in New York; and it is not particularly close. But, he was also a Republican in a Democrat-majority state. I think everyone would have predicted this. Surely, our moderate Republican will look better when compared to his fellow Republicans in the House...

![Zeldin-v-R](/assets/img/Lee_Zeldin_NY_Republicans.png)

Aaaaand it does not look any better. Hmm. In the years that he had his string of pro-EPA votes, he was still 9 and 15 percentage points below his Republican peers, respectively. 

# Maybe Not so Shocking

And so I ask: are we seriously supposed to believe that this is the voting history of a pro-environmentalist who suddenly went rogue in 2025? You don't get to call yourself a pro-climate, moderate Republican when your voting history looks like this. Since 2015, Zeldin has made his stance abundantly clear, and yet we are suddenly shocked when he said in January, shortly after being confirmed by the Senate, that "There has been talk through the years about how the world was imminently about to end because of climate change, and in the name of that threat there was a push to do some crazy things," and that recent legislation has wasted tax dollars "in a way that was inexcusable, unjustifiable and illegitimate."? It is an absurd proposition that the NYT, Politico, and others have proposed to their readers for reasons that escape me. 

If we are still legitimately questioning whether Zeldin was speaking from both sides of his mouth during his time in the House (and not particularly effectively, at that) because he said that climate change was real once or twice, I have to call into question whether anyone even *wants* to pay attention, or if we truly believe that his "180" was a 180 at all. His immediate endorsement of Trump--who since he entered the political scene has made his views about the environment abundantly clear--in 2016 should have been enough and yet, it wasn't. 

Since his confirmation, the EPA has announced it will be [virtually eliminating mandatory greenhouse gas emissions data from power companies](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-epa-greenhouse-gas-reporting-climate-crisis), [canceled a $10 million grant for the Mountains and Plains Thriving Communities Collaborative](https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/09/trump-ends-funding-epa-maptcc-rural-tribal-communities/), and said that the way forward in [ensuring clean air in American and "restoring American Energy Dominance" is by removing "costly permitting processes"](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-administrator-zeldins-powering-great-american-comeback-unveiled-epa). And none of it is particularly surprising to hear from an agency spearheaded by Lee Zeldin. 

Here's to 4 years of the dismantling of environmental protections from the "moderate Republican"; who could have possibly seen it coming?
