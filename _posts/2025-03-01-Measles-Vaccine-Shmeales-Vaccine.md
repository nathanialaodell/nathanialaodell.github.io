title:  "Physicians for Informed Consent, Measles Vaccine Misinformation and Bad, No Good Statistics"
categories: [Misinformation response]
---

In what has become our new norm, the Children's Health Defense (CHD) has recently(ish) released yet [another](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/measles-mumps-rubella-infection-mmr-vaccine-risk/) article railing against the measles vaccine. The claims made in the article hilariously entitled "No Proof MMR Vaccine Is ‘Safer’ than Measles, Mumps or Rubella Infection, Physician Group Says" rely largely on evidence and data presented on the [Physicians for Informed Consent](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/) (PIC), which "has a vision of... evaluating data objectively". A very noble mission indeed, and one that all researchers and medical practitioners should strive for. 

EDIT: I should note that I began this post prior to the measles outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, began. Take the irony of that as you read through this post as you will. 

# The Main Claim
The main claim of this article can be best described as dubious at best, and intentionally vague at worst. What exactly is meant by "harmful" in the context of the measles vaccine is elusive, likely purposely so. Does the vaccine have higher mortality rates than the MMR infection? Is it side-effects of the vaccine that we are comparing to adverse health effects of MMR infection? If so, which side effects, and how do we know that their is a causal relationship between said side effect and our outcome? By not specifying *what it even is that we are talking about* it allows these bad faith arguments to be impossible to properly address. When you counter claims of higher mortality rates due to vaccine-related side effects when compared to MMR-related deaths, they can simply say that they were never arguing that point, anyway. And technically they would be right, because they never established what it was that they were arguing. 

In any case, [this](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/mmr-vrs/) report referenced in the CHD article is where the bulk of iffy-science and plain bad stats comes from. Let's tackle it bit by excruciating bit.

# The Good of the PIC MMR Vaccine Risk Report
---
The report opens by stating that the MMR vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of MMR infections. This is true and uncharacteristically transparent of such an anti-vaccine group. Broken clocks and all that.

I also agree with their concerns about the lack of proper surveillance systems in place to track MMR-vaccine related deaths. How they plan to get funding for such an endeavor is not mentioned, however, and their citing of the [CDC VAERS system](https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html) for the claim that there are 40 MMR vaccine-related deaths per year is, again, ignorant at best. Anyone, and I mean **anyone** can report a death in this system without proof, as the webpage itself states:
> Although VAERS tracks some adverse events, it is too inaccurate to measure against the risk of measles, mumps, and rubella

Moving on.

# The Bad of the PIC MMR Vaccine Risk Report

### All Relative!
---
To begin, they state that "seizure... occurs in about 1 in 640 children vaccinated with MMR [vaccine] - about fives times more than seizure from measles infection."

The 1 in 640 figure is from a [2004 paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/199117) that estimated the rate of febrile seizures in vaccinated versus unvaccinated children (I should note: it is a very fine paper that is worth at least a skim if you have the time). I cannot find this exact figure anywhere within the paper, but for the sake of moving this post along I will assume that this number is derived from some other figure within the article (that, again, I cannot find).

What this 1 in 640 figure does not include is a reference group. It is more informative and thus common to portray this figure *relative* to a reference point which, in this case, would be the febrile seizure rate in children that are **not** vaccinated from MMR; otherwise known as the relative risk (RR) of febrile seizure in children that are vaccinated. The PIC claims that this figure is five times more than febrile seizures linked to measles infection. If true, this number should be enough to raise many, many alarms within the public health space. But, is it true? The claim is certainly not from the original paper and is conveniently provided without citation. So what *did* the authors find? 

> Overall, we found that the rate of first febrile seizures was 10% higher among vaccinated children (7445; person-years at risk, 1 151 661) compared with nonvaccinated children (10 541; person-years at risk, 793 568) during the study period (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15), after adjusting for age and calendar period. However, the rate of febrile seizures increased during the first (RR, 2.46; 95% CI, 2.22-2.73) and second week (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.89-3.49) following vaccination only


For the statistically indifferent readers, this means that there was no difference found between febrile seizure rates in children that did and did not get vaccinated from MMR over the entire study period. They did find that the there was a 146% and 217% increase in febrile seizures rates for children that were vaccinated after one and two weeks (respectively). 

And so the question becomes whether or not this is proof that the Measles vaccine is dangerous. Not really. There are two potential reasons for this, straight from the author's keyboard:
> In Denmark, most children are vaccinated against MMR at age 15 to 17 months when the incidence rate of febrile seizures is peaking... Our study showed that the transient increased rate of febrile seizures was restricted to 2 weeks following vaccination, the risk difference was small even in children at high risk of febrile seizures, and the long-term rate of epilepsy was not increased in children who had febrile seizures following MMR vaccination compared with children who had febrile seizures of a different etiology.

These are not exactly damning pieces of evidence to support the PIC's and by extension the CHD's claims.

### But the Lack of Trials Though!
---
The PIC report then points to the fact that the MMR vaccine's health label states that: 
> M-M-R II vaccine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.

This is absolutely true, and is more of a practical problem than a malicious one. 

I want you to take a moment to consider what would be required to test whether there is a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and infertility, for example. Really. Take a moment to create a study design for this research question. Thought about it? Let's discuss. 

To establish this type of causal link would require you to perform a study akin to a prospective cohort study: we would have to begin studying participants when they are roughly 12 months old (i.e., immediately when they get their first MMR vaccine) and *continue following up with them until a specified age cut off point*. This would entail having a large enough participant pool to make loss to follow up a negligible issue, being able to ensure that infertility wasn't a result of other, unrelated exposures, and somehow obtaining the immense amount of funding to complete such a project.

# The Ugly of the PIC MMR Vaccine Risk Report

### 50,000 Study Participants?
---


![lots_of_people](/assets/img/3b26b5dc-f1d1-4bfa-8c68-5e79b32411e7_text.gif)


The coup de grâce of this report asserts--not alludes to, not implies, but plainly states--that because the "cumulative annual risk of a fatal or permanently disabling case of [any of] MMR was 1 in 50,000 [over a 10 year period]", clinical trials that "only" have a "few" thousand participants are not sufficient "to prove that the MMR vaccine causes less permanent disability or death than measles, mumps, and rubella,". Yes, this is a real quote. Yes, the PIC is made up of real doctors. Yes, those real doctors are implying that a clinical trial must enroll fifty-thousand (50,000) participants to be capable of proving that the MMR vaccine is safe.

I could go into statistical power, and how we can readily and easily calculate how many participants are needed in each arm of a randomized control trial to be able to illustrate whether there is a statistically significant difference in two different intervention groups (say, I dunno, MMR vaccinated compared to not vaccinated). But that is not even necessary if you understand the generalizability of a proper sampling group of participants, or, I dunno, the absurdity of an RCT where you enroll 50,000 participants.

Are you beginning to notice a trend here? The bar is purposely set unattainably hard so that it is impossible to reach. You don't ever have to actually defend your claims if it you make it impossible to combat them. 

### Ignoring Confounders
---
Perhaps even more egregious than the previous section is the complete lack of respect for the epidemiological community and its related research. Take for example the paragraph entitled "How Accurate Are Epidemiological Studies of the MMR Vaccine?"; very subtle. They begin this paragraph by providing their definition of a confounder:
> Epidemiological studies are hindered by the effects of chance and possible confounders — additional factors that could conceivably affect the groups being studied.

This is a rather simplistic definition that ultimately misses the nuances of the concept itself. Confounders are not just "affecting groups being studied", they are factors that are associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest, which bias our results. Also, what exactly is meant by "hindered" alludes me; are a study's results hindered by a confounder if we... control for the confounder? Probably not, unless my entire education has been a lie (Big Pharma, is that you?). This is an intentional attempt to undermine epidemiological work, but it doesn't stop there. 

In any case, if the adjusted RR and unadjusted RR have a difference as high as 36% (according to PIC's own figures; see table 1 below), [it is likely that we have confounding, anyway](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0031-1298595.pdf)... 

### Bad, No Good, Ugly Statistics Interpretations

They then go on to claim that a well-known 2022 [Danish study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed) that examined whether there is an association between MMR vaccination and autism. In it, they naturally controlled for confounders such as age, socioeconomic status, birth weight, etc. The PIC's counter to this study's findings can be boiled down to "nuh uh". 
> The raw data in the study was adjusted, in an attempt to account for potential confounders, and the study found no association between the MMR vaccine and the adverse events. However, because there is no evidence that the estimated confounders used to adjust the raw data were actually confounders, the study did not rule out the possibility that the MMR vaccine increases the risk of an adverse event that leads to permanent injury by up to 77%

There are many problems with this 77% figure, and so in an effort to demystify (bio)statistics let's go slowly. Let's start by looking at this table they provide:

![PIC_RR_goof](/assets/img/PIC_RR_goof.png)

To begin, their definition of the confidence interval is simply not very good--allow me to use an analogy to illustrate why. To do this, we have to suspend our disbelief regarding confounders and assume that the PIC is correct regarding that issue; a difficult task but one that we should take on nonetheless. The first reported RR is that of the original study after they adjusted for confounders: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.24), which is the same as saying that the risk of autism in vaccinated children is 8% lower than unvaccinated, pointing to the MMR vaccine being a preventative exposure. When we don't control for confounders, we instead observe an effect of vaccinated children being at a 45% higher risk of autism than unvaccinated children (RR = 1.45 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.77)). They then go on to say that the "potential RR" is 1.77, which translates to a 77% greater risk of autism in vaccinated children. A very scary figure indeed.

But where did that 1.77 number come from? It isn't equal to the "unaltered RR" (1.45). What is it equal to? Drum roll please... **The upper limit of the unaltered RR's confidence interval**. This is comically bad statistics. here's where that analogy comes into play: before Mount Everest was discovered, what was the tallest mountain in the world? The answer is Mount Everest. This is, in effect, what a confidence interval actually illustrates: your population parameter has already occurred and is thus fixed, but it is unknown to you. That is, the data you collected is random, and so your **estimated** interval may or may not contain the **true, unknown** parameter (rate febrile seizures). Claiming that the upper limit of your interval is the "potential RR" is complete nonsense and illustrates a complete lack of understanding of fundamental, elementary statistical methodology. 


# Circling Back to CHD
---
I am sure that for the uninformed and the reporters employed at the CHD, such as the one that wrote the very article that spawned this response (a UT alumni, by the way. Plus one for the Red Raiders!), it is exciting to think that you are combatting the big bad. That you have your third eye open, or whatever. I believe the confirmation of RFK Jr. as the HHS secretary confirms that this is a increasingly popular sentiment in the United States. 

The continued, seemingly unstoppable degradation of education in this country saddens me greatly. But, as any money-starved yet humble researcher would agree, what might mend my wounds is some Big Pharma money.

So! I implore someone to connect me with one of these Big Pharma companies that manages to simultaneously operate in the shadows and control the entire epidemiology community; even the lowly arbovirus researchers of the world (hello there!) that do not even know it yet. 

If I had gotten in contact with them sooner, perhaps I would not have wasted multiple years working for free to produce research in the pursuit of pushing the scientific literature forward and to improve the world in some incremental way. Silly me.
